# JavaFx/Stack Heap Experimentation Projects

-	During college in my second semester I created a JavaFX cross platform desktop app based around a Computer store in which customers, products and order objects are created.
-	Demonstrated a variety of patterns, (Singleton pattern, MVC Pattern) 
-	Experimented with the Java Stack and Heap. (How many objects can be created until a crash occurs?) 
-	Implemented serialization and deserialization in plain csv files to store the objects.
-	Migrated this storage system over to a relational database (SQLite)
